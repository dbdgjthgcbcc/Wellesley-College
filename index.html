                <p class="text-muted text-left">A swimming pool, swimming bath, wading pool, paddling pool, or simply pool, is a structure designed to hold water to enable swimming or other leisure activities. Pools can be built into the ground (in-ground pools) or built above ground (as a freestanding construction or as part of a building or other larger structure), and may be found as a feature aboard ocean-liners and cruise ships. In-ground pools are most commonly constructed from materials such as concrete, natural stone, metal, plastic, or fiberglass, and can be of a custom size and shape or built to a standardized size, the largest of which is the Olympic-size swimming pool.</p>

                <p class="text-muted text-left">A school library (or a school library media center) is a library within a school where students, staff, and often, parents of a public or private school have access to a variety of resources. The goal of the school library media center is to ensure that all members of the school community have equitable access "to books and reading, to information, and to information technology." A school library media center "uses all types of media... is automated, and utilizes the Internet [as well as books] for information gathering. "School libraries are distinct from public libraries because they serve as "learner-oriented laboratories which support, extend, and individualize the school's curriculum... A school library serves as the center and coordinating agency for all material used in the school."</p>

                <p>How exciting it was to hear the Wellesley Orchestra and music students perform to such a high standard in the annual Itinerant Music Teachers’ concert recently.
                    <br>
                    Around 60 boys learn music 1:1 with a music tutor during school time at Wellesley. The annual concert is an opportunity for students who are ready, to perform to an appreciative audience of parents, friends and family.
                    <br>
                    The diverse programme delivered exceptional performances by the boys on a range of instruments from all areas of the orchestra as well as voice, in a range of styles from classical to rock.
                    <br>
                    The high standard of performance is particularly noteworthy considering the challenges of lockdown this year. Music lessons and orchestra rehearsals continued online without missing a beat, even during the school holidays.

                <p>When Weta Workshops started a marble run competition, many schools immediately began planning and designing the ultimate marble run, and Wellesley was no different. As soon as the word was out, Ms Fox called together 3 enthusiastic and creative boys from each year 5, 6, 7 and 8 class to get to work. On the first day we started planning, and within a few days construction was underway.
                    <br>
                    Even though we were all working so hard, by the time the day came there was still a lot to do! We worked tirelessly throughout the day, however when the time came to film it problems started appearing all over the place. It took us ages to fix them all, and by the end of the day we still hadn’t got it right. We started the next day refreshed and determined with the marble crew ready to keep trying.
                    <br>
                    We tried again and again and again and, well you get the idea, AGAIN, and finally we accomplished our goal, but for some reason we were still not satisfied. The commentary in the first video wasn’t our best and then there were times when the camera struggled to focus on the small and fast moving marble. We just kept trying, another few attempts later and we got it!
                    <br>
                    Then all there was left to do was pack it all up! That was the least fun part and it took us a while, and boy there was a lot of mess, but we got there. I know we all want to win this and receive the distinction of being crowned Wellington’s Most Creative Classroom!

Born in Hastings, New Zealand, he developed an early interest in aviation and joined the RAF in 1936. He completed his flight training the following year and was posted to the RAF's No. 73 Squadron, where he flew the Gloster Gladiator and then the Hawker Hurricane. On the outbreak of the Second World War the squadron was dispatched to France. He began flying operational sorties during the Phoney War and gained his first aerial victory, a German bomber, in November 1939. A second bomber was destroyed days later. In March 1940 he claimed his fifth aerial victory, and became the RAF's first flying ace of the Second World War as well as its first recipient of the Distinguished Flying Cross. During these encounters, his fighter was damaged on more than one occasion and he was wounded in action. His success so early in the war and subsequent media reports meant he became well known in Britain and the Dominions.<br>
